### Hey, I'm Kelli! 

I'm a Research Scientist and Bioinformatician with a passion for working with next-generation sequencing data to extract actionable insights. I recently completed my Ph.D. at UC San Diego where I coupled experiment-based and sequencing-based methods to study microbial adaptation to extreme enviornments, and I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my interdiscipinary skills to new research domains where I can have a meaningful, positive impact on humans and the environment. I am eager to collaborate with others who share my passion and enthusiasm for leveraging next-generation sequencing data to drive scientific knowledge forward.
